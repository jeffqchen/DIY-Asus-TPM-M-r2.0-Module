I created this adapter board so that I can use the module I created for Asus motherboards with Asrock motherboards. Yes, turns out they are compatible, just with the pins shuffled!

-------

# Parts

- 18-1 pin (2x9) pin header, female, 2.0mm pitched, right angle
- 14-1 pin (2x7) pin header, male 2.0mm pitched, right angle

-------

# Note

Remember to trim the missing pin on the male pin header for better anti-inverse measure!
